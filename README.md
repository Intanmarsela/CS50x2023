Hello World!

This is Intan Marsela, but most people call me Marsela. I want to share a little bit about my journey into programming.

In June 2023, I decided to study IT in Sydney. My first big step was signing up for CS50 by Harvard University.

It took me about six months to finish all 12 weeks of CS50 lectures and assignments. It was tough, but I learned a lot. At first, all the technical terms sounded strange, but I slowly started to get them. Even though I used to hate math, I found myself enjoying solving problems because I finally understood what I was doing.

Starting with Scratch and then moving on to C as my first programming languages helped me understand the basics and why things work the way they do. Understanding was key for me.
