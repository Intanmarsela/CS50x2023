To get into the crime scene report in 28 July on Humphrey Street.
SELECT * FROM crime_scene_reports WHERE day = 28 AND month = 7 AND street = 'Humphrey Street' AND description LIKE "%duck%";

From the report, we have to look into interviews on that day and all the interviewee mention about "bakery".
SELECT * FROM interviews WHERE day = 28 AND month = 7 AND transcript LIKE ("%bakery%");

There are 3 interviews, each of it lead us to the thief.
First witness Ruth, mentioned that "Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame."
If we go to
SELECT * FROM bakery_security_logs WHERE day = 28 AND month = 7 AND activity = "exit" AND hour = 10;
We can find Bruce in the security log with id 262.

Second witness Eugene, mentioned that "Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money."
If we look at the atm transaction on Leggett Street with withdrawing transaction type we will find that he is doing the transaction.
But first we will need to find his acount number using JOIN function.
SELECT * FROM atm_transactions
JOIN bank_accounts ON atm_transactions.account_number = bank_accounts.account_number
WHERE atm_location = 'Leggett Street' AND transaction_type = 'withdraw'
AND bank_accounts.account_number IN (SELECT bank_accounts.account_number FROM bank_accounts
JOIN people ON bank_accounts.person_id = people.id
WHERE name = "Bruce"
) AND day = 28;
From the data we could find that he is withdrawing $50 from the atm machine on Leggett Street on that day.

The third witness Raymond said that"they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute."
SELECT caller, receiver, month, day, duration FROM phone_calls
JOIN people ON phone_calls.caller = people.phone_number
WHERE name = "Bruce" AND duration <= 60 AND day = 28;
From here we could see that Bruce made a call under one minute which is 45sec.
And the person he called was Robin
SELECT * FROM people WHERE phone_number = "(375) 555-8161";

The second line that Raymond mention was
"I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket"

SELECT
    f.id AS flight_id,
    f.year,
    f.month,
    f.day,
    f.hour,
    f.minute,
    origin_city.city AS origin_city,
    destination_city.city AS destination_city
FROM flights f
JOIN airports origin_city ON f.origin_airport_id = origin_city.id
JOIN airports destination_city ON f.destination_airport_id = destination_city.id
WHERE origin_city = "Fiftyville" AND day = 29 AND month = 7 ORDER BY hour LIMIT 1;

In this table we could see the first flight from Fiftyville on the next day of the accident.
In this table the we could see the flight_id is 36.
And the destination is New York City.

SELECT flight_id,people. passport_number AS passport_number ,seat FROM passengers
JOIN people ON passengers.passport_number = people.passport_number
WHERE name = "Bruce";

From here we could see that Bruce is that flight.
