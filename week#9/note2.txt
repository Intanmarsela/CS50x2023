# Implements a registration form using a select menu

from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

SPORTS = [

 "Ultimate Frisbee"
]

    @app.route("/")
    def index():
        return render_template("index.html", sports=SPORTS)

 @app.route("/register", methods=["POST"])
    def register():
        # Validate submission
        if not request.form.get("name") or request.form.get("sport") not in SPORTS:
            return render_template("failure.html")
        # Confirm registration
        return render_template("success.html")

--indx.html
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block body %}
    <h1>Register</h1>
    <form action="/register" method="post">
        <input autocomplete="off" autofocus name="name" placeholder="Name" type="text">
        <select name="sport">
            <option disabled selected>Sport</option>
            {% for sport in sports %}
                <option value="{{ sport }}">{{ sport }}</option>
            {% endfor %}
        </select>
        <button type="submit">Register</button> //for submiting the form
<   /form>
{% endblock %}

{% endfor %} is the closing syntax for Jinja

For selecting options we can make a global variable and it will work same as option.

We can put require in the <input require> so the user will have to fill the form before leaving.
It will be able to give alert notification aswell

Cookie is like a hand stamp, to recognize you all the time. So they don't have to log-in again and again.

http header that make cookie
cookie: session=value

session; a function in Flask that will help you with cookie.

if not session.get("name"); this line will redirect you to loginn if you are not logging in yet.

Session will end when we close the tap, but it could plented in the device more than that.
Each cookie will always be different.

API
It how you interact with some service.
Webbase that could give you data from somewhere else
like weather, real time covid case, etc
