In this lesson, I learned how the building blocks of programming from prior lessons can be implemented within Python. Further, I learned about how Python allowed for more simplified code. Also, I learned how to utilize various Python libraries. In the end, I learned that my skills as a programmer are not limited to a single programming language. Already, I am seeing how I am discovering a new way of learning through this course that could serve me in any programming language – and, perhaps, in nearly any avenue of learning! Specifically, we discussed…

Conditionals
Loops
Types
