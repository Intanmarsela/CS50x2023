Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

The result that we obtain after the simulation:

Men World Cup 2018                      Woman World Cup 2019
1. Belgium                              1. Germany
2. Brazil                               2. United State
3. Portugal                             3. England

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

The result are changing as the running time (N) changing. The result accuracy also improve when the running time (N)
improve however the real running time also getting longer.

The prediction is getting close to accurate after 100000 times.
